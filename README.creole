= Vaadin KML example =

This is a simple example how one can load KML file from third party server, 
de-serialize it with JAXB/Kml library and visualize in with OpenLayers Wrapper.

The source KML this app uses is in TM35FIN coordinates, so the app also suits 
as an example how to use custom projections with OpenLayers Wrapper.
